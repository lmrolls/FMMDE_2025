% estimateFactorsMDDM - Estimates Factor Model with Prespecified Factors
%
% Description:
%   Estimates a factor model for a stationary multivariate time series using
%   the cumulative Martingale Difference Divergence Matrix (CMDDM), as
%   described in Lee & Shao (2018). The function computes the CMDDM over
%   k0 lags, performs spectral decomposition, and estimates the factor
%   loadings, factors, and common component for a prespecified number of
%   factors r. Focuses on factor estimation rather than determining the number
%   of factors.
%
% Inputs:
%   Y     - T x n matrix, time series data with T observations and n variables
%   k0    - Positive integer, number of lags for cumulative MDDM
%   r     - Positive integer, prespecified number of factors to estimate
%
% Outputs:
%   fhat  - T x r matrix, estimated factors (F_hat)
%   Ahat  - n x r matrix, estimated factor loadings (Lambda_hat)
%   chat  - T x n matrix, estimated common component (F_hat * Lambda_hat')
%   ss    - n x 1 vector, eigenvalues of the cumulative MDDM

% Notes:
%   - Requires the MDDM function to compute the sample Martingale Difference
%     Divergence Matrix for each lag.
%   - Eigenvalues are sorted in descending order to select the r eigenvectors
%     corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, representing non-MDS factors.
%   - Assumes Y is properly formatted, k0 is less than T, and r is not greater
%     than n.
