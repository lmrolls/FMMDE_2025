% factorMDDM - Estimates Factor Model using Martingale Difference Divergence Matrix
%
% Description:
%   Estimates a factor model for a stationary multivariate time series using
%   the cumulative Martingale Difference Divergence Matrix (CMDDM), as
%   described in Lee & Shao (2018). The function computes the CMDDM over
%   k0 lags, performs spectral decomposition, and estimates the factor
%   loadings, factors, and common component. It also estimates the number of
%   factors using an eigenvalue ratio method.
%
% Inputs:
%   Y     - T x n matrix, time series data with T observations and n variables
%   k0    - Positive integer, number of lags for cumulative MDDM
%   r     - Positive integer, number of factors to estimate
%
% Outputs:
%   fhat   - T x r matrix, estimated factors (F_hat)
%   Ahat   - n x r matrix, estimated factor loadings (Lambda_hat)
%   chat   - T x n matrix, estimated common component (F_hat * Lambda_hat')
%   ss     - n x 1 vector, eigenvalues of the cumulative MDDM
%   icstar - Integer, estimated number of factors based on eigenvalue ratios

%
% Notes:
%   - Requires the MDDM function to compute the sample Martingale Difference
%     Divergence Matrix for each lag.
%   - The number of factors is estimated using the eigenvalue ratio method but
%     capped at the input r.
%   - Assumes Y is properly formatted and k0 is less than T.
